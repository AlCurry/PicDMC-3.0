PicDMC
PicDMC is short for picture distance, map, (weather & time) conditions. The app uses the IOS UIImagePickerController to allow the selection of a photo. Based on the photo’s meta data, specifically gps latitude and longitude, it determines the user’s current distance from where the picture was taken. Also the address, current weather, and time at the picture's location. These details are displayed in the lower left of the picture.
From this view, a user may select "Photo", to display the original image, "Map" to show the address on a map, or "Select" to select another image. A couple of included screen shots illustrate this.
There are some possible icons which could be used in place of text for the buttons included in the projects Assets.xcassets, though my preference is for text. Button color can be customized in line 21 of AppDelegate.swift.
There are settings for the app implemented using the IOS Setting Bundle for metric or imperial measurements, font color (black or white), and whether or not to display labels.  Also InAppSettingKits cocoa pod was used to access the settings from within the app.
